MVP:  
A mobile-fist single-page-web-app for Salem, Oregon bus transit.

Unlike many other cities across the United States, Salem, Oregon has failed to develop a worthwhile mobile application for its bus transit system. The goal of this project is to address that in the easiest, most-convenient fashion possible. The web app will present the MVP for this concept.

## Updated user stories
- The user will be able to load the page and see a search bar
- The user will be able to input a bus stop ID
- Upon searching for bus stop ID, the user will see upcoming bus route numbers to that stop
- The user will be able to report if a bus is late, on time, or early
- The user will see if a bus route is running late
- The user will be able to press 1 of 5 buttons: 1.) The bus is more than 10 minutes early 2.) the bus is 5 minutes early 3.) The bus is on time 4.) The bus is 5 minutes late 5.) The bus is more than 10 minutes late
