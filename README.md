MVP
A mobile-fist single-page-web-app for Salem, Oregon bus transit.

Unlike many other cities across the United States, Salem, Oregon has failed to develop a worthwhile mobile application for its bus transit system. The goal of this project is to address that in the easiest, most-convenient fashion possible.

## Updated user stories
- The user will be able to register, login, and logout
- The user will be able to choose from and/or filter by bus route
- The user will be able to choose stop they are waiting at
- The user will be able to press 1 of 5 buttons: 1.) The bus is more than 10 minutes early 2.) the bus is 5 minutes early 3.) The bus is on time 4.) The bus is 5 minutes late 5.) The bus is more than 10 minutes late
- The user will be able to see updates from other users for all buses, or filter for a specific bus
