A mobile-fist single-page-web-app for Salem, Oregon bus transit.

Unlike many other cities across the United States, Salem, Oregon has failed to develop a worthwhile mobile application for its bus transit system. The goal of this project is to address that in the easiest, most-convenient fashion possible.

- The app will have a splash screen explaining basic functionality
- At a minium the application will display all routes
- The application will require GPS location for accurate position reporting, the user will opt-in to this
- The user will be able to search for a destination via Google Places API
- App will select the best route/stop based on users destination input
- User will be able to tap a button and get the closest bus stop

Stretch goals: 
- Select routes to display on main page via drop down or similar menu
- User will be able to login
- User will be able to favorite routes
- Upon the user opting in, the user will automatically report arrival/departure times from stops based on lat/long values gathered from device.
- Arrival times automatically adjusted down stream of users reporting crowd sourced data
